**Yet another free stock ticker!**

If like me, you have a meagre amount of money "invested" in stocks and 
shares, then you're probably interested in how they're doing - 
usually badly of course!  I wanted a ticker that would sit in the corner of 
my PC screen, that wouldn't take up too much space, be easy to configure and didn't 
ask me every five minutes for either an upgrade or some money.  
Equally, I wanted something that wasn't emblazoned with branding and other 
useless advertising crap.

Well, guess what, I couldn't find one!  Most offerings either cost money, 
lack an overall summary display or look like some sort of Star Trek gizmo.

So, back in 2000, I wrote my own.  

Feel free to criticise or make suggestions 
for enhancements etc.  I do development on this to keep me from going insane 
in my normal development job, so I'm always looking for some sort of distraction....  
My goal is to keep it simple and lightweight.

To see how it works, how to configure it etc. see the [WIKI](https://github.com/steveohara/stockticker/wiki)
