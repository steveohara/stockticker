# Contributing

All contributions are welcome!

You can contribute simply by asking a question or by suggesting a change/fix without having to commit code, but feel 
free to contribute code via the Pull Request mechanism.

## Contributing Code

Your code changes should be cloned from the `master` branch, this is the branch that the releases are built from and 
from which the online GitHub pages are sourced.

## Guidelines

For the best chance of getting your changes incorporated into the code base, please follow these guidelines;

* Follow the coding style already established - same indentation, line spacing, naming convention etc.
* Thoroughly comment your code and provide proper VB6 headers, even for private methods/functions
* Don't introduce any dependencies over an above what is available already on a Windows 
machine i.e. no OCX or OLE DLLs etc.
