			Stock Ticker?</a></h2>
			<hr>
			<p>If like me, you have a meagre amount of money &quot;invested&quot; in stocks and shares,
			then you&#39;re probably interested in how they&#39;re doing - usually badly of course!&nbsp;
			I wanted a ticker that will sit in the corner of my screen, that
            won't take
			up too much room, is easy to configure and didn&#39;t ask me every five minutes for either
			an upgrade or some money.&nbsp; Equally, I wanted something that wasn&#39;t emblazoned
			with branding and other useless advertising crap.</p>
			<p>Well, guess what, I couldn&#39;t find one!&nbsp; Most offerings either cost money, lacked an
			overall summary display or looked like some sort of Star Trek gizmo.</p>
			<p>So, using some code we have here for showing application status,
            I wrote my own and this is the results of my efforts.&nbsp; Feel
            free to criticise or make suggestions for enhancements etc.&nbsp; I
            do development on this to keep me from going insane in my normal
            development job so I'm always looking for some sort of
            distraction....&nbsp; My goal is to keep it simple and lightweight.</p>
			<p>Pivotal Stock Ticker uses Yahoo to get it&#39;s quotes so depending upon the stock
			exchange, all quotes are delayed by at least 15 minutes.&nbsp; If this isn&#39;t a problem
			for you, then Pivotal Stock Ticker might be just the gadget for you.  In future releases,
			I might introduce a way in which you can connect the ticker to the non-free version
			of Yahoo Finance and get real-time quotes via your Yahoo subscription.</p>

			<h2><a name="What_does_it_do_">What does it do?</a></h2>
			<p>Pivotal Stock Ticker allows you to monitor stocks that you have
            purchased, the current
			value of those stocks and the effect of any changes to those stocks on the value
			of your portfolio.&nbsp; This last bit is the thing that I most wanted from the
			ticker myself i.e. If I bought X shares of Yahoo at Y amount in 2007 and then bought
			more shares at a different cost in 2008 what is my overall position now?&nbsp; Am
			I up (not likely) or down (more than likely)?</p>
			<p>I also needed to keep track of shares that I had bought in different exchanges
			in different countries e.g. London as well as New York or the NASDAQ etc.&nbsp;
			To make sense of this, Pivotal Stock Ticker understands foreign exchange (glad someone
			does) and converts values/costs from the currency they are traded in, to your local
			currency real time - it uses Yahoo FX rates.</p>
			<p>Pivotal Stock Ticker allows you to change the colours, sizes and fonts of your
			symbols and you can also customize the amount of actual data that is displayed.&nbsp; It also
			shows charts of your stocks daily performance when hovering over symbols and it
			doesn&#39;t get confused by multiple display monitors.&nbsp; You can
            also &quot;dock&quot; the toolbar to the top or bottom of the screen so that
            it isn't hidden by Windows toolbars and maximised top most
            applications.</p>
			<p>The application is written in VB6 and runs on any Windows platform - there are
			no dependencies built into the executable apart from the ubiquitous msvbvm60.dll
			runtime library and the GDI+ runtime.&nbsp; Both of these are included in the setup
			file but you are likely to have both of these on your machine already.</p>
			<p>It does what I need it to do and probably does what you need too - give it a
			try and if you like it perhaps you might want to &quot;invest&quot; a donation towards its
			development.&nbsp; There&#39;s no obligation to pay money, but it would put a smile
			back on my face if you did and make it much more likely that I will answer any questions
			you have.</p>
			<p>Enjoy! (if that&#39;s the right emotion when viewing your stocks)</p>

<p>The display is drag-able simply by clicking on any part of the black area and
dragging the window around the screen.&nbsp; The system won&#39;t allow you to drag
it off the screen and it will remember the position for ever more so that next you
run the ticker it displays in the last place you left it.</p>
<p>The sizing handles at each end of the display allow you to adjust the width of
the display by dragging them with the mouse.</p>
<p>The display is split into two main sections; <a href="#Summary">Summary</a> and
